        Respected Sir,<br /><br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am Vaibhav Magar from K. K. Wagh currently
        studying in Second Year IT Engineering. <br />
        I am writting this letter to request for a leave of 30 days.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, Devsnest is a institution which is
        giving free programming knowledge and they are <br />
        basically trying to make everyone educate with this knowledge, which
        will open doors for <br />
        being financially independant. And It is organizing Code Camp for 30
        days in next month, it <br />
        will be in Mumbai and I want to attend this code camp as they are
        goining to teach basic <br />
        and advance programming stuff which will be surely helpful for me for my
        IT carrier. Hence, <br />
        I really wish to attend it. <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In these 30 days of Code Camp, whichever
        syllabus will be covered in college I will cover <br />
        it once I come back. And before leaving, I will complete my all
        assignements.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hope you understand the need of this Code Camp for education purpose.

        <br /><br />
        Yours Faithfully, <br />
        Vaibhav Magar.
