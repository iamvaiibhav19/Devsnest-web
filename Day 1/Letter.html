      <br />

      Respected Sir,<br /><br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am Vaibhav Magar from K. K. Wagh currently
      studying in Second Year <br />
      IT Engineering. I am writting this letter to request for a leave of 30
      days.
      <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, Devsnest is a institution which is giving
      free programming knowledge <br />
      and they are basically trying to make everyone educate with this
      knowledge,<br />
      which will open doors for being financially independant. And It is
      organizing <br />
      Code Camp for 30 days in next month, it will be in Mumbai and I want to
      att- <br />
      -end this code camp as they are goining to teach basic, intermediate and
      adv- <br />
      ance programming stuff which will be surely helpful for me for my IT
      carrier. <br />
      Therefore, I really wish to attend it. <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In these 30 days of Code Camp, whichever
      syllabus will be covered in <br />
      college I will cover it once I come back. And before leaving, I will
      complete <br />
      my all assignements.
      <br />
      <br />
      Hope you understand the need of this Code Camp for education purpose.

      <br /><br />
      Yours Faithfully, <br />
      Vaibhav Magar.
